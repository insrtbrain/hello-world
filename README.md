# hello-world
This is a thing that say hello

Working towards becoming a self-taught programmer.  Got to FCC Random Quote Generator challenge and had no clue where to start.  Decided to find more depth to knowledge.  Working through p1xt guides.

Realized I did not understand git and a basic level.

So Hello World.
